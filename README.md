# FusionHelperOnQuest
Trying to get fusion helper bonelab on quest!

You might be asking yourself how?

Well this is what I think,

Running Ubuntu Server on a termux session that is running in the background
Run SteamCMD on Ubuntu Server

Login to steam and download steamvr(On SteamCMD wiki just search it up)

Run Fusion Helper ARM 64
Have Fun!


Update:

SteamCMD does not work and Fusion Helper Arm64 was taken down before I downloaded it.

I Gotta use normal steam.
